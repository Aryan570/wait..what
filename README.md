This is the Project where you can gather your notes. I tried to make this personalized, as when you go to the website, you see, you are asked to upload a banner, which would be on your profile when getting your notes. You can edit the banner, just by clicking on the banner. 
#This Project was fun, because. - 
* First time working with TypeScript. And I don't wanna go back to JavaScript, I am still new, but I will keep on working with TypeScript.
* First time using @shadcn-ui . It was a great experience for the most part, and will definitely use it for future projects.
* UploadThing - Funny thing, I actually saw this tool and then decided to make a project around it. LOL.
* First time working with Next-Auth.
* Learning about mongoDB was fun.

#Learnings from Project-
* TypeScript
* Learnt a lot about Next-Auth.
* UploadThing is supercool.
* MongoDB is so easy to work with (for this project, maybe it is. but its so deep).
* Learnt about shadcn-ui.
* And last, NextJS 13 is a game changer.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
